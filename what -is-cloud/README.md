## Question to Answer

## 1. What is Cloud Computing?

* __ delivery of computing power, database, storage, application and other
* Usually uses pay-as-you-go pricing

## 2. How do we know if something is in the cloud?

  Ask yourself:
  * Are the resources delivered as a service over the internet?
  * Are the resources available on demand?
  * Are the resources centrally managed?

If yes, then it is in the cloud!

Prem - on premises. Means private data centers that companies house in their own facilities and maintain themselves

## 3. Deployment models of Cloud?

### Public Cloud

* Shared with the public
* AKA multiple-tenants 
* Owned and operated by cloud service provider
* Delivered over the internet

### Private Cloud

* AKA single-tenant cloud
* Mostly the organisation that sets it up.
* Dedicated to the private organisation
* Could be hosted on prem or a data centre where they rent their data on space. 
* Could be used when there is no internet (e.g. on a cruise ship).

Adv:
  * Not exposed to the public
  * Complete control over the hardware and infrastrucutre

### Hybrid Cloud 

* Mix of on on-prem and public cloud 

### Multi-Cloud
* Bring in another cloud provider.
* Using multiple cloud providers.

## 4. Types of cloud services: IaaS, paaS, SaaS

* IaaS: Infrastructure As A Service
* SaaS: Software As A Service
* PaaS: Platform As A Service
  
On-premises: In control of everything but also responsible. Example of tasks that the software can do: data, applications, runtime, middleware, o/s, virtualisation, servers, storage and networking.

Iaas: You manage data, applications, runtime, middleware, o/s. Provider manages virtualisation, servers, storage, networking. An example is a vm.

Paas: You manage data and applications. Provider manages runtime, middleware, o/s, virtualisation, server, storage and networking. An example is an app service. To make sure security top-notch, you need to make sure the code is secure and runs without errors.

SaaS: You manage the data. Provider manages applications, runtime, middleware, o/s, virtualisation, servers, storage and networking. A few examples are, ServiceNow, SalesForce, Office365. You run the code. 

## 5. What are the advantages/disadvantages of the Cloud?

* Adv: Protecting the security and the privacy of user's information is upmost priority.
* Adv: Various layers of higher-level security the closer into the centre of the campus you get.
* Adv: Data centre and networking rooms are the highest form of security.
* Adv: Highest level security rooms use underfloor instrusion detection via laser beams.
* Adv: Use a biometric iris scanner. 
* Adv: Scalability
* Adv: Sustainability (they think about the carbon footprint created)
* Adv: Redundancy
* Adv: Access from anywhere with internet
* Adv: Global reach 
* Disadv: Needs a lot of manpower to keep servers running 24/7.
* Disadv: High voltage demands for massice data centres and heat loss from processors and cooling systems 
* Disadv: Huge amount of organisation needed
* Disadv: Needs an efficient cooling system.
* Disadv: Bad for the environment - loads of power needed for the cooling systems. 
* Disadv: Possible high costs for consumer and also the company/organisation. 
* Disadv: Data centre is typically a little warm to help with the efficiency. Could be problematic in the summer.

### Difference between OpEx VS CapEx and how it relates to the Cloud

OpEx
* Operational Expenditure
* Pay monthly
* Usually how you pay for cloud services
* Better for start-ups financially 

CapEx
* Capital Expenditure
* Pay up front
* Usually more CapEx with on-prem

### Is migrating to the cloud always cheaper?

* Going to depend on the organisation 

2 types of calculators to help determine:
* Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator
* Cost Calculator

### Guaranteed levels of service
* Possibility you can get some credit back if SLA is not achieved
* SLA (Service Level Agreement) - guarantee to provide you as a customer a certain level of service, e.g. 99.999% uptime
* SLO (Service Level Objective) - higher than the SLA. E.g. 99.9995%.

### MarketShare - Who are the biggest cloud providers (Big 3)?
* Amazon (30%)
* Microsoft (20%)
* Google (12%)
* Alibaba, Oracle, Saleforce, IBM (5-10%)
  
### Which cloud provider do you think might be the best?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) maintains a strong lead, commanding 30% of the global market with nearly $30 billion in quarterly revenue.

On an annualized basis, thatâ€™s nearly $120 billion, more than the entire revenue of Nike, Disney, or Coca-Cola. AWS provides a wide range of cloud infrastructure tools, including computing, storage, databases, and developer services.

* There are adv + disadv for each. (Ramon's Answer) 

### What sort of things do you usually need to pay for when using the cloud?
* Usually you need to pay for services which:
  * Use computer power + RAM
  * Use storage space
  * Create traffic (OUT of the network, called "egress"). Do not need to pay for the in-going of the network.
  * Are in limited supply e.g. Public IP addresses

## What do you already know about the cloud?
Cloud computing is basically accessing computer resources without using a physical computer. Saving/using files you use on the cloud means that we could use it anytime. 
## How have you used the cloud?
I have used the cloud daily by saving files on Onedrive. 
## What would you like to know/understand/do with the cloud?
I would like to understand the services that make the cloud behind the scenes.
